# Learning Log – Session 03

## What I set up today
- Downloaded the Think Python Jupyter notebooks
- Unzipped them into the notebooks/ folder

## What I learned from Chapters 1 and 2
- difference of integer and floating point numbers
- concatenation
- difference between natural and formal languages
- variable names can not start with numbers
- comment to explain in natural language what the program is doing
- different types of error

## Things that feel unclear right now
- How VS Code works with GitHub
- Creating template for answering questions for learning logs

## Questions for next class
- How does VS Code and GitHub collaborates
